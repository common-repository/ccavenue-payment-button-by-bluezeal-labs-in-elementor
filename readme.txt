For test transactions:
"https://test.ccavenue.com/transaction/transaction.do?command=initiateTransaction"
This form is used to initiate a transaction with the CCAvenue test environment (https://test.ccavenue.com). Transactions made through this form will not process real payments but can be used for testing purposes. This is typically used during the development and testing phase of the plugin.

For live transactions:
"https://secure.ccavenue.com/transaction/transaction.do?command=initiateTransaction"
This form is used to initiate a transaction with the live CCAvenue environment (https://secure.ccavenue.com). Transactions made through this form will process real payments and should only be used in a production environment after thorough testing.

The payment processing is handled by CCAvenue and users should follow the guidelines provided by CCAvenue for secure transactions.
